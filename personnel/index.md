Tailscale reviews risks on a regular basis, to ensure proper mitigations are in place.

### Reference Checks
As part of its hiring process, Tailscale does not perform criminal background checks, but does employ a reference check process for prospective employment candidates prior to or within 30 days of their hire date.

### Security Awareness training
All employees must complete Tailscale’s information security awareness training as part of their initial onboarding and thereafter, while still under contract, on an annual basis.

### Performance Reviews
All full time employees must complete an annual Performance Review, the results of which are signed and dated by both the employee and their manager, and uploaded to the employee’s personnel files in the HR system.
