### Purpose

Tailscale must retain certain kinds of data for a minimum amount of time, to comply with legal requirements. At the same time, Tailscale wants to avoid retaining any identifiable data for longer than is necessary, in case of a breach.

### Scope

This policy applies to the data assets associated with customer accounts that are processed by Tailscale in connection with providing the Tailscale Solution.

### Policy

#### Schedule

Tailscale must review the data it retains as part of reviewing its data register quarterly.

#### Retention period

Data subject to this policy will be retained for a set period of time, depending on the type of data:

<table>

</table>

\*Tailscale acts as the data processor for this information pursuant to our DPA. In all other cases, Tailscale acts as the data controller.

Where not specified, customer data must be retained no longer than is needed to provide the service, and anonymized or deleted afterwards.

#### Privacy Policy

Tailscale must delete customer data in accordance with the commitments, if any, made in [Tailscale’s Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy/). If the privacy policy is updated, the above retention periods must also be updated to reflect any changes.

#### Deletion method

Data may be destroyed by overwriting on disk, deleting a cloud resource, encrypting and destroying the key, resetting a device, and/or physical destruction.
Tailscale will delete personal data pursuant to individual data subject requests in accordance with applicable data privacy laws as set forth in our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy/).

### Suspension

Tailscale may suspend routine deletion of customer data if required for security forensic analysis purposes or a legal hold involving such data. Legal holds may be issued, for example, in connection with an active, imminent, threatened or reasonably anticipated investigation, litigation, arbitration, subpoena, financial transaction, or other legal matter.

### Roles and responsibilities

Tailscale’s Security Review team is responsible for reviewing and updating the Data Retention policy requirements on an annual basis.
