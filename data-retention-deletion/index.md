### Scope

### Schedule

Tailscale should review the data it retains as part of reviewing its data register at least annually.

### Retention period

Data subject to this policy will be retained for a set period of time, depending on the type of data:

\*Tailscale acts as the data processor for this information pursuant to our DPA. In all other cases, Tailscale acts as the data controller.

Where not specified, customer data will be retained no longer than is needed to provide the service, and anonymized or deleted afterwards.

### Privacy Policy

Tailscale will delete personal data pursuant to individual data subject requests in accordance with applicable data privacy laws as set forth in our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy/).

### Suspension

Tailscale may suspend routine deletion of customer data if required for security forensic analysis purposes or a legal hold involving such data. Legal holds may be issued, for example, in connection with an active, imminent, threatened or reasonably anticipated investigation, litigation, arbitration, subpoena, financial transaction, or other legal matter.

### Deletion method

Data may be destroyed by overwriting on disk, deleting a cloud resource, encrypting and destroying the key, resetting a device, and/or physical destruction.
